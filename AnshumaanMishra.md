My name is Anshumaan Mishra. I like AI/ML, especially LLMs and love to keep myself up to date with latest tech.
My favorite pokemon is Alakazam as it can sweep through any gym and is available fairly early in most mainline Pokemon Games. Also, spoons go brrrrrr.

I would also like to take my time warning people against the Gengar Propaganda. Just because you have a large tongue does not mean youcan eat Ice Creams faster. Alakazam has up to 5 spoons. Beware, stay safe.
